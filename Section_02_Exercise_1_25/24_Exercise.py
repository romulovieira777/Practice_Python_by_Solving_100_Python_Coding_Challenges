Exercise No. 24

Write a function that takes a list and a number as arguments. Add the number to the end of the list, then remove the
first element of the list. The function should then return the update list.

Examples:
    next_in_line([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1) -> [6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 1]

    next_in_line([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10) -> [6, 3, 23, 17, 10]

    next_in_line([1, 10, 20, 42], 6) -> [10, 20, 42, 6]

    next_in_line([], 6) -> "No list has benn selected"

Notes:
    For an empty list input, return: "No list has been selected"
"""


def next_in_line(lst, num):
    return lst[1:] + [num] if lst else "No list has been selected"


print(next_in_line([1, 10, 20, 42], 6))
