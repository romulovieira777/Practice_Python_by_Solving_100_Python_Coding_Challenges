Exercise No. 21

Given a list of boxes, create a function that returns the total volume of all those boxes combined together. A box
is represented by a list with three elements: lengths, width and height.

For instance, total_volume([2, 3, 2], [6, 6, 7], [1, 2, 1]) should return 266 since (2 * 3 * 2) + (6 * 6* 7) +
(1 + 2 + 1) = 12 + 252 + 2 = 266

Examples:
    total_volume([4, 2, 4], [3, 3, 3], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1]) -> 63

    total_volume([2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1]) -> 10

    total_volume([1, 1, 1]) -> 1

Notes:
    - You will be given at least one box.
    - Each box will always have three dimensions included.

print(total_volume([4, 2, 4], [3, 3, 3], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1]))
