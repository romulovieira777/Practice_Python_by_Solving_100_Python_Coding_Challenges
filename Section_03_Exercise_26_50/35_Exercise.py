Exercise No. 35

Write a function that counts the number of times a specific digit occurs in a range (inclusive). The function will look
like:
    digit_occurrences(start, end, digit) -> number of times digit occurs

Examples:
    digit_occurrences(51, 55, 5) -> 6
    # [51, 52, 53, 54, 55] : 5 occurs 6 times

    digit_occurrences(1, 8, 9) -> 0

    digit_occurrences(-8, -1, 8) -> 1

    digit_occurrences(71, 77, 2) -> 1

Notes:
    - Ranges can be negative.
    - start <= end
"""


def digit_occurrences(start, end, digit):
    return ''.join(str(i) for i in range(start, end + 1)).count(str(digit))


print(digit_occurrences(71, 77, 2))
