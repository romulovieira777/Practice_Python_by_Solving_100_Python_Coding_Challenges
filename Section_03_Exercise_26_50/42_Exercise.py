"""
Exercise No. 42

Create a function that takes a string and censors word over four characters with *.

Examples:
    censor("The code is fourty") -> "The code is ******"

    censor("Two plus three is five") -> "Two plus ***** is five"

    censor("aaaa aaaaa 1234 12345") -> "aaaa ***** 1234 *****"

Notes:
    - Don't censor words with exactly four characters.
    - If all words have four characters or less, return the original string.
    - The amount of * is the same as the length of the word.

def censor(s):
    return ' '.join('*' * len(i) if len(i) > 4 else i for i in s.split())


print(censor("aaaa aaaaa 1234 12345"))
