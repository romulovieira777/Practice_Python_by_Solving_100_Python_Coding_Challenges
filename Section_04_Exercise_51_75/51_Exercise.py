Exercise No. 51

Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence. In cases where more than one word is found,
return the first one.

Examples:
    find_longest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!") -> "perpetually"

    find_longest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") -> "forever"

    find_longest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") -> "forgetfulness"

    find_longest("\"Strengths" is the longest and most commonly used word that contains only a single vowel.") ->
    "strengths"

Notes:
    - Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
    - Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
    - You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
