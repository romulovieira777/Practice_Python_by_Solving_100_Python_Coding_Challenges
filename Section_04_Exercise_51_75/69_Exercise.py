Exercise No. 69

What do the numbers 4, 6, 8, 9 and 0 have in common? They all have holes in them! Notice how the number 8 contains not
one, but two holes.

Give a list of numbers, sort the list in accordance to how many holes occur in the number. It should be sorted in
ascending order.

Examples:
    holey_sort([44, 4, 444, 4444]) -> [4, 44, 444, 4444]

    holey_sort([100, 888, 1660, 11]) -> [11, 100, 1660, 888]

    holey_sort([8, 121, 41, 66]) -> [121, 41, 8, 66]

Notes:
    - If two numbers have the same number of holes in them, sort them by the order they first appeared in.
    - Despite the number 0 appearing to have two holes in certain fonts, it will only have one hole for the purposes of
    this challenge.
