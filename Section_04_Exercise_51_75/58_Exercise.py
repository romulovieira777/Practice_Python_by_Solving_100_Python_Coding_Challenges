Exercise No. 58

Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list.

Examples:
    sum_primes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) -> 17

    sum_primes([2, 3, 4, 11, 20, 50, 71]) -> 87

    sum_primes([]) -> None

Notes:
    - Given numbers won't exceed 101.
    - A prime number is a number that has exactly two divisors.
