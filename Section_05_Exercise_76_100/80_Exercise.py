"""
Exercise No. 80

Create a function that returns the simplified version of a fraction.

Examples:
    simplify("4/6") -> "2/3"

    simplify("10/11") -> "10/11"

    simplify("100/400") -> "1/4"

    simplify("8/4") -> "2"

Notes:
    - A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (expect 1) between the numerator and the denominator. For
    example, 4/6 is not simplified, since 4 and 6 both share 2 as a factor.
    - If improper fractions can be transformed into integers, do so in your code (see example #4).
