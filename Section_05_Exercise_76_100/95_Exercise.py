Exercise No. 95

A Fibonacci string is a precedence of the Fibonacci series. It works with any two characters of the English alphabet (as
opposed to the numbers 0 and 1 in the Fibonacci series) as the initial items and concatenates them together as it
progresses similarly to that of the Fibonacci series.

Examples:
    fib_str(3, ["j", "h"]) -> "j, h, hj"

    fib_str(5, ["e", "a"] -> "e, a, ae, aea, aeaae"

    fib_str(6, ["n", "k"]) -> "n. k, kn, knk, knkkn, knkkknknk"

Notes:
    - All values for n will be at least 2.
    - It is expected from the challenge-takers to come up with a solution using the concept of recursion or the
    so-called recursive approach.

fib_str = lambda n, f: ','.join(f) if n == 2 else fib_str(n - 1, f + [f[-1] + f[-2]])


print(fib_str(6, ["n", "k"]))
